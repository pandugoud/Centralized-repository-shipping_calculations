# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a simple interest calculator implemented in Python.

## Formula
The formula used is:

SI = (P * R * T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest per year
- T = Time in years

## Example
If you invest $1000 at a rate of 5% per year for 2 years:

SI = (1000 * 5 * 2) / 100 = 100

So, the simple interest earned will be $100.
